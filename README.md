# Diamond Price Prediction
Regression model to predict the price of diamond
   
### Background problem / Goal:
In this project, we are going to build a predictive model for Intelligent Diamond Reseller (a new diamond reselling business) in order to estimate how much the market will pay for diamonds. 

### Tools/Libraries Used: 
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels

### Workflow:
1. Data Acquisition
2. Inspection and exploration
3. Cleaning and preparation
4. Visualization
5. Modeling & Evaluation
6. Forecasting
7. Summary & Further Outlook
